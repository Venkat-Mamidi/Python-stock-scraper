This python program uses the webscraping library BeautifulSoup and the requests package in order to scrape stock market information.
This python program asks a series of questions regarding which stocks to view (top 20 gainers or losers), what time frame to view them on (daily, weekly, monthly), and how to order them (percentage change, price, volume, etc.)
